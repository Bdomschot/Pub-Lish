## User Notes
This was a first time colaboration for this team, and the first draft in building this site.  The goal was to start with a product at its base that is clean, functional, and user friendly. Below are some of the features we would include on future drafts.
* Ability to broaden search parameters beyond just city name. Examples being is it dog friendly, local brews only, cider houses, location to specific areas, food options, popularity, etc.
* Create a way for users to sign in and have private accounts. 
* Allow user to save multiple seaches their own account.
* Build a social community around the site where users can interact with eachother and the the pub owners.  Then allow them to give reviews, ask questions, design/share meet ups, ect.
* Add ride share information links for the private accounts to taxi/uber/lift 
* Make it possible to design searches based on distance or type of transportation.  Example being is it bike friendly, vs walking, vs ride share, etc
